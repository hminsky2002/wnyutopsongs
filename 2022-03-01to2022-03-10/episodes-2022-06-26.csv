47304,"Highlighting artists who combine the frenzied energy and DIY spirit of punk music with the desperation of blues music, The American Nightmare plays punk-blues and noise-rock artists from the 80's and 90's who typically flew under the radar in the larger, global punk scene. With many thanks to groups like The Birthday Party (Nick Cave's first band) and The Cramps, a new fascination with the grotesque and macabre of the American South seeped well beyond its borders, and a new strain of punk music originated in the mixing of punk and blues music. Finding harmony in their modest roots and themes of the depraved and dejected in their lyrics, punk and blues music combine wonderfully into this new genre.
