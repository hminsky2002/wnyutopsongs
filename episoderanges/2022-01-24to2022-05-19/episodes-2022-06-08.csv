Sovietwave, arising from a seemingly nostalgic yearning for the Space Age, is beyond an impending sense of red doom often associated with its production. Its richness lies in the subtleties of scientific curiosity, establishing individual autonomy over the collective, and childhood reminisce of what the failed state could have been. The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.

Sovietwave, arising from a seemingly nostalgic yearning for the Space Age, is beyond an impending sense of red doom often associated with its production. Its richness lies in the subtleties of scientific curiosity, establishing individual autonomy over the collective, and childhood reminisce of what the failed state could have been. The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.

The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.

Sovietwave, arising from a seemingly nostalgic yearning for the Space Age, is beyond an impending sense of red doom often associated with its production. Its richness lies in the subtleties of scientific curiosity, establishing individual autonomy over the collective, and childhood reminisce of what the failed state could have been. The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.

Sovietwave, arising from a seemingly nostalgic yearning for the Space Age, is beyond an impending sense of red doom often associated with its production. Its richness lies in the subtleties of scientific curiosity, establishing individual autonomy over the collective, and childhood reminisce of what the failed state could have been. The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.

47654,"Perestroika digs deep into a post-Soviet world of experimentation between bass, synth, and airy lo-fi beats. Sovietwave, arising from a seemingly nostalgic yearning for the Space Age, is beyond an impending sense of red doom often associated with its production. Its richness lies in the subtleties of scientific curiosity, establishing individual autonomy over the collective, and childhood reminisce of what the failed state could have been. The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.

Sovietwave, arising from a seemingly nostalgic yearning for the Space Age, is beyond an impending sense of red doom often associated with its production. Its richness lies in the subtleties of scientific curiosity, establishing individual autonomy over the collective, and childhood reminisce of what the failed state could have been. The satellite states current fascination for the intensity of the genre is highlighted in its evolutionary beginnings, with the Russian duo PPK serving as the amniotic sac fusing with the then current scene of trance music. As the embryo began to form within the 2010’s, political tensions were at an all-time high in Kiev’s uprisings towards Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Explosions of tension filled techno began to swarm Eastern European independent artists' consciousness, alongside remnants of Latvian disco and angsty rock. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we also began to see viral Tik Tok’s of Belarusian group Molchat Doma’s audios entering a mainstream space. While Depeche Mode takes credit for synth-pop, Eastern European traditions continue to lay the groundwork for greater questions of what the dreamscape is for each individual who creates Eastern music within a Western world.
